# Repository Improvement Ideas

This document lists some recommendations to make this project easier to develop and maintain.

## Add Git Ignore
- Include a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, build output in `dist/`, editor settings, and temporary logs.

## Provide a License
- Adding a `LICENSE` file makes it clear how others can use the project. The MIT license is a simple permissive option.

## Expand Documentation
- Document how to install dependencies, run the Angular application, and execute unit tests.
- Provide links to additional resources for Angular development.

## Continuous Integration
- Consider setting up a workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on each commit.
